**A Chrome extension that blocks focus and tab visibility tracking.**

No popups. No settings. Just works.

## 🧠 What does it do?

The extension disables JavaScript APIs that websites use to track:

* Tab switching (`visibilitychange`)
* Focus loss (`blur`, `focus`)
* Window events (`window.onfocus`, `window.onblur`)
* Real-time user activity tracking

Works on *all websites* and requires no manual configuration.

## 💼 Who needs it?

* Participating in technical interviews on platforms like **Yandex Code**
* Don't want websites to track your tab
